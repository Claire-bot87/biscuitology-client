## Build Process

First i built out he back end. I added:
I added three applications in my project. They were 
-biscuits
-pairings
-users

Then I added into each of these applications:
models (for the schema)
Views (handles the logic)
Urls (routing)

Once i had completed these and tested them using postman, I moved onto thte front end. 
I created components , 
And placed them in my app.jsx file, which i imported into my Main.jsx file

I used UserProvider for ………..
I used BrowserRouter for ………

I enabled the user to add, delete and update a biscuit, ensuring my apllication had full CRUD functionality. 

Then I worked on the metrics.
